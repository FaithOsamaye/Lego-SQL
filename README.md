# <p align="center" style="margin-top: 0px;"> Recommendation
1. If the company is all about making more money then they should definetely make the school aged children their main target audience

2. The gear theme had the most count in our data and the normal category was the most sort after. So, it is of importance more variations of the normal category be produced.

3. The companies should keep making more legos and if new ideas come about it should be put into it as the rise in lego games overtime has skyrocketed.

4. To make teenagers amongst our target audience, we need to do market survey and find out the type of legos that would be more enjoyable to children around that age.
